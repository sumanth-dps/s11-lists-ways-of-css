                Wayne</mark> relocates to Asia,
            where he is mentored by Henri Ducard and <b>Ra's Al Ghul</b> in how to fight evil. When learning about
            the
            plan
            to wipe out evil in Gotham City by Ducard, Bruce prevents this plan from getting any further and heads
            back
            to
            his home. Back in his
            original surroundings, <strong>Bruce adopts the image of a bat</strong> to strike fear into the
            criminals
            and
            the corrupt as the icon known as "Batman".<br><br>Fourteen years later, Chill testifies against the
            mafia
            crime
            boss, Carmine Falcone,
            and is paroled. Bruce intends to murder Chill to avenge his parents, but one of Falcone's hitmen does so
            first.
            Bruce's childhood friend, Rachel Dawes, berates him for acting outside the justice system. After
            confronting
            Falcone, who says real power comes from being feared, Bruce spends the next seven years traveling the
            world,
            training in combat, and immersing himself in the criminal underworld. In a Bhutan prison, he is
            approached
            by
            Henri Ducard, who recruits him to the League of Shadows, led by Ra's al
            Ghul. The League believes Gotham is beyond saving and intends to destroy it. After completing his
            training,
            Bruce rejects the League and its mandate that killing is necessary. He escapes, burning down their
            temple in
            the
            process. Ra's is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves the unconscious Ducard. Intent on fighting
            crime,
            Bruce returns to Gotham and takes an interest in his family's company, Wayne Enterprises, which is being
            taken
            public by businessman William Earle. Company archivist Lucius Fox, a friend of Bruce's father, allows
            him
            access
            to prototype defense technologies, including a protective bodysuit and the Tumbler, an armored vehicle.
            Bruce
            poses publicly as a shallow playboy while setting up a base in the caves beneath Wayne Manor and taking
            up
            the
            vigilante identity of "Batman," inspired by his childhood fear, which he has now conquered.</p>

            betraying and killing
            each

            The vigilante Batman, district attorney Harvey Dent, and police lieutenant Jim Gordon ally to eliminate
            Gotham's
            organized crime. Batman's true identity, the billionaire Bruce Wayne, publicly supports Dent as Gotham's
            legitimate
            protector, as Wayne believes Dent's success will allow Batman to retire, allowing him to romantically

            Gotham's mafia bosses gather to discuss protecting their organizations from the Joker, the police, and

            Joker interrupts the meeting and offers to kill Batman for half of the fortune their accountant, Lau,
            concealed
            before fleeing to Hong Kong to avoid extradition. With the help of Wayne Enterprises CEO Lucius Fox,
            Batman
            finds

            families. The bosses accept the Joker's offer, and he kills high-profile targets involved in the trial,
            including
            the judge and police commissioner. Although Gordon saves the mayor, <strong>Joker threatens that his
                attacks

            Rachel
            out of a
            window, but Batman rescues her.<br><br>Wayne struggles to understand the Joker's motives, but his butler
            Alfred Pennyworth says "some men just want to watch the world burn." Dent claims he is Batman to lure
            out
            the Joker, who attacks the police convoy transporting him. Batman and Gordon apprehend the Joker, and
            Gordon
            is promoted to commissioner. At the police station, Batman interrogates the Joker, who says he finds

            entertaining and has no intention of killing him. Having deduced Batman's feelings for Rachel, the Joker
            reveals she and Dent are being held separately in buildings rigged to explode. Batman races to rescue
            Rachel
            while Gordon and the other officers go after Dent, but they discover the Joker gave their positions in
            reverse. The explosives detonate, killing Rachel and severely burning Dent's face on one side. The Joker
            escapes custody, extracts the fortune's location from Lau, and burns it, killing Lau in the
            process.</p>

        <p class="moviePlot"><b>PLOT:</b><br><br>Eight years after the events ofThe Dark Knight (2008) find Gotham
            at a
            time
            of
            peace.<b>This is due to Batman taking the fall for Harvey Dent's murder.</b> However, a new evil force
            named
            Bane
            has arrived in Gotham and aims to take over the city and expose the truth behind who Harvey Dent really
            was.
            Now
            that Wayne Manor
            has been completely rebuilt, Bruce Wayne has become almost reclusive, rarely leaving the estate. And
            with
            Bane
            taking over the city by force, it forces Batman to come out of retirement.But his allies are few and far
            between. An elusive jewel thief by the name of Selina Kyle could be the key to stopping Bane, but whose
            side
            is
            she on?..<br><br>Bane, a former member of the League of Shadows, leads an attack on a CIA plane over
            Uzbekistan to
            abduct nuclear physicist, Dr. Leonid Pavel, and fake Pavel's death in the crash. Meanwhile, eight years
            after the death of Gotham City District Attorney Harvey Dent[a], organized crime has
            been eradicated in Gotham by legislation, the Dent Act, giving expanded powers to the police. James
            Gordon,
            police
            commissioner, has kept Dent's killing spree a secret and allowed the blame for his crimes to fall on
            Batman.
            Bruce Wayne, still mourning the death of Rachel Dawes, has become a recluse, and Wayne Enterprises has
            stagnated.<br><br>

            Bane enlists businessman John Daggett to buy Bruce's fingerprints. Burglar Selina "Catwoman" Kyle steals
            Bruce's
            prints from Wayne Manor for Daggett, but he double-crosses her, and she alerts the police, who pursue
            Bane
            and
            Daggett's henchmen into the sewers while Catwoman flees. The henchmen capture Gordon and take him to
            Bane,
            but
            he escapes and is found by Officer John Blake, an orphan who has deduced Bruce's secret identity and
            persuades
            him to resume his vigilantism. Bane attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange and uses Bruce's fingerprints to
            verify a
            series of fraudulent transactions, leaving Bruce bankrupt. Batman resurfaces to pursue Bane's henchmen.
            Fearing
            Bruce will get himself killed fighting Bane, his butler, Alfred Pennyworth, resigns in the hope of
            saving
            him
            after admitting to burning a letter that Rachel left for him saying she was going to marry Dent. Bane
            expands
            his operations and kills Daggett while Bruce and Wayne Enterprises' new CEO, Miranda Tate, become
            lovers.<br><br>

            Catwoman agrees to take Batman to Bane but instead leads him into a trap under Wayne Tower. Bane gloats
            that
            he
            intends to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's mission to destroy Gotham City before he brutally cripples Batman in
            combat.
            He then takes Bruce to an ancient underground prison in the Middle East, where Bruce learns that Ra's al
            Ghul's
            child was born and raised in the prison but had a protector that aided the child in escaping, thought to
            be
            impossible. Back in Gotham, Bane traps the police forces in the sewers, destroys all but one bridge
            surrounding
            the city, kills Mayor Anthony Garcia, forces Pavel to convert a fusion reactor core into a decaying
            neutron
            bomb
            before killing him. He exposes Dent's crimes to the city (thus undermining the legal system) and
            releases
            the
            prisoners of Blackgate Penitentiary, taking over the city, and has Gotham's elite exiled and killed in
            proletarian kangaroo courts presided over by Jonathan Crane.</p>
